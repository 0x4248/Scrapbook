# Scraps

Random code examples, experiments, and other stuff that don't belong to a full repository.

## Repo structure 

Each folder contains a different "scrap" with its own `README.md` file and the code itself. Most of them also have a `Makefile` to run the code.

## License

By default, all code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. If the folder contains a `LICENSE` file, that license applies to the code in that folder unless otherwise stated. You can also see the license [here](https://0x4248.dev/Legal/gpl-3.0.html)
