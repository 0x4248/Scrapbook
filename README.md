# Scrapbook

Welcome to my scrapbook, this is my collection of experements, code, fragments, scripts and some other little projects. Here you can find me tinkering around with some random hardware and software. For other files like binaries and files that dont fit here check the [JunkDrawer](https://github.com/0x4248/JunkDrawer).

## Repo structure 

Each folder contains a different "scrap" with its own `README.md` (sometimes just `README` or with another extension) file and the code itself. Think of it like an image in the **scrapbook** with some postit notes.

## License

By default, all code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. If the folder contains a `LICENSE` file, that license applies to the code in that folder unless otherwise stated. You can also read the license [here](https://0x4248.dev/Legal/gpl-3.0.html)
