GIT
===

The Scrapbook uses git heavily as part of its workflow. Below im going to give a
quick overview on how each commit works.

BASE COMMITS
------------

The default commit style is like this:

MODULE: MESSAGE

This is so that you can see at a glance what subproject or module was modified.
A commit can also have a second line that explains the commit better, GitHub
hides this under the three little dots.

You may also see a signoff, the Makefile workflow does this by defaut.
