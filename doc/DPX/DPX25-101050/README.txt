A design proposal for writing DPX records in text based files and documents.

SPECIFICATION

When writing DPX records in a text based format, please follow these rules to
ensure consistency throughout.

DOCUMENT RULES

Keep the page to 80 cols in width (100 maximum, 80 minimum), use tabs with a
width of 4 and LF encoding. ANSI or UTF-8 is ok but the document should be in
english, characters like Greek can be used for formulas.

HEADER

The top of the file should have the metadata of the record, below is an example:
