<h1>Welcome to Atlas</h1>

Atlas provides a navigable view into the internal workings of this repository a mix of experiments, low-level prototypes, and assorted systems code.

Nothing here is arranged for show; directories reflect the actual structure of the work: boot code, small utilities, test rigs, hardware notes, and fragments that existed solely to answer a technical question at the time.

Use the explorer to move through the tree and inspect individual projects. Atlas will also show you the <i>README</i> files and notes put on each folder. Some folders contain complete tools; others hold only a few lines of code or a build script used once and kept for reference. Treat this space as a working archive rather than a polished product.

If you are looking for items that don’t fit neatly into source control such as binary dumps, temporary artifacts, and other debris go to <i>ext/JunkDrawer</i>.

<b>Atlas Features</b>

Tho Atlas looks simple at first glance, it has some useful features to help you
navigate the repository such as:

* <b>Quick Github Links:</b> When any file is open you can jump to its Github page
  by clicking the <i>View on GitHub</i> button at the top right.
* <b>Markdown Rendering:</b> README files and notes are rendered in HTML for
  easier reading.
* <b>Line Numbering:</b> Code files show line numbers to help you reference
  specific parts of the code.
* <b>RAW View:</b> You can view the raw text of any file by clicking the
  <i>View RAW</i> button next to the Github link.
* <b>Similar File Search:</b> When viewing a file, you can search on github for
    files with a similar file name by clicking the <i>Search Similar Files</i> button.

<i>Note:</i> Atlas is a work in progress and may have some rough edges. Atlas also
can not open raw or large files, therefore it will show a message when it encounters
such files.
