Root Guard
===========

What is Root Guard?
----------------------
Root Guard is a simple library to quickly inject a root user check into C/C++ sbin
programs. It does several checks to determine if the program is being run by the
root user or even by a user with root privileges.
Since just checking the UID isnt always enough, Root Guard performs multiple
checks.

Root Guard can be used anywhere as a static binary.

rg <COMMAND> 

This works in the same way as sudo does, you can even run sudo with it to check
for root privileges.

sudo rg whoami
