The Language Trail
===================

What is The Language Trail, well its like a hike trough the entire C and C++ library from
the beginning and as well as other major languages that I want to try out like PHP and Lua.

*why?*

I want to get more fluent in C/C++, tho I think this project is going to take a
long time to complete
